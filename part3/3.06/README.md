# DBaaS vs DIY


### 1. **Initialization**
   - **DBaaS**:
     - quick and straightforward
     - minimal configuration required
     - allows devs to focus on dev time instead of db setup
   - **DIY**:
     - requires expertise to set up, configure, and maintain
     - need to setup on-prem machines, or cloud VM's

### 2. **Cost Structure**
   - **DBaaS**:
     - subscription-based pricing
     - predictable expenses, however they can balloon quickly if not tracked. For example, using snowflake when devs have no idea how to use it can be a nightmare from a costs perspective (been there, done that).
     - includes maintenance and usually support
   - **DIY**:
     - high initial costs
     - expenses aren't predictable. they could even be more expensive than a DBaaS if not enough expertise is in the company ("oops, our prod db has been down for a week")

### 3. **Maintenance**
   - **DBaaS**:
     - maintenance is fully managed by the provider, including updates, patches, and monitoring
     - automated updates ensure the database is secure and up-to-date.
   - **DIY**:
     - all maintenance responsibilities fall on your team
     - requires regular updates, security patches, performance tuning, and disaster recovery planning

### 4. **Scalability**
   - **DBaaS**:
     - easily scalable with dynamic resource allocation
     - features like automatic failover, load balancing, and replication are often included
   - **DIY**:
     - scaling is a complex process
     - may involve upgrading hardware, optimizing configurations, or redesigning the architecture
     - needs expertise to scale up

### 5. **Backup Methods**
   - **DBaaS**:
     - integrated backup solutions
     - backups are stored securely and can be restored easily
     - some providers offer advanced features like point-in-time recovery
   - **DIY**:
     - must set up and manage your own backup processes
     - backup processes include scheduling, ensuring backup integrity, and securing storage locations
     - implementing advanced recovery features can be extremely complex

### 6. **Ease of Use**
   - **DBaaS**:
     - designed for ease of use, so even a data analyst can use them
     - allows users to manage databases without deep technical knowledge
     - ideal for devs focusing on development
   - **DIY**:
     - requires in-depth knowledge of database systems
     - need a database architect, and a supporting team
     - more challenging to manage but offers greater customizability

### 7. **Control & Customization**
   - **DBaaS**:
     - limited control and customisation
     - constraints on software versions, config options, and sometimes architecture
     - suitable for most projects
   - **DIY**:
     - full control over the database environment.
     - highly customizable to meet specific reqs
     - necessary for projects with unique needs
